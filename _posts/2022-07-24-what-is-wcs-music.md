Some time ago, we had a new DJ at one of our weekly West Coast Swing
socials. At a café afterwards, they asked the other staff and DJs: "What makes
a song a good West Coast Swing Song? I understand too slow or too fast, but I can't tell why some
rhythms work and some don't". Surprisingly, none of us could articulate what makes a West Coast
Swing song beyond "I know it when I hear it". Well and truly nerd-sniped, I went off and researched
as much as I could, and the result is the following content.

Swing is a genre of music[^swing_music], but most of us would
struggle to dance WCS (West Coast Swing) to a swing standard from [Benny
Goodman](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1pBuKaLHJlIlqYxQQaflve?si=7469Fl34QROI8JRWH5sfnw), unless
you came from Lindy Hop. Unlike Salsa or Mambo, WCS hasn't attached itself to a
singular musical genre; you can't select "West Coast Swing" as a genre on spotify.
Pop charts today include RnB, rock, hip-hop, electronic, country and more, so
how do we decide what to dance to? Many of us feel like we could identify a "West Coast Swing song"
if we tried dancing to it, but if we attempted to explain why to someone else, I think we'd struggle.
I've collected my thoughts on the subject here to hopefully provide others with the tools to
articulate what makes a song WCS Music or not.

One of the early responses I heard to this question was "You can WCS to any song, so doesn't that make
any song a WCS song?". This is like saying "every car is a fast car because it's faster than
walking", which is true, but not very useful if you want to compare cars. When I say
a song is a "West Coast Swing" song, I mean that it encourages dancing WCS *more* than
it encourages dancing a different dance style. 

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">I've put together a

Listen to each song and write down whether you think it has a WCS rhythm or not. Then after reading this post, go back over the playlist and see if any of your answers change. </div>

## Dancing to the Music

I've always liked the phrase: "if your grandma is watching you dance and she forgot her hearing
aid, she should be able to tell what kind of music you are dancing to". Or, put another way: your
dancing should reflect the music currently playing.

_Partner dancing_ introduces further complexity in that you now have to communicate your 
musical expression with someone else. Thankfully, in the same way that a language has a vocabulary,
the West Coast Swing community has a common set of physical vocabulary (e.g. the slot, anchors, etc) 
that means we don't have to start from scratch with every new partner. Ideally, the music is
conducive to the physical conversation that we are having, that it encourages us to speak our common
WCS language.

So, when I say "what is West Coast Swing music" I mean "Does the physical expression of
this music use physical language that West Coast Swing community understands?".

With that out of the way, lets dive in and see what we can learn!


## Rhythm

Aside from tempo, I believe the most important aspect when matching a dance style to a song is the
_rhythm_. I define rhythm as the time relationship between different events, and the relative
emphasis on those events. In music, these "events" are different notes played by an instrument.
In dancing, the events are marked by movement in our bodies.
Our WCS patterns have an innate rhythm which we can compare with the musical rhythm of a particular song. 

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
Terminology alert! Musicians usually count in four-beat bars (a.k.a. measures) while our basic WCS rhythms 
(walk-walks and triple steps) are only two beats long. This is why dancers usually count rhythms in two-beat sections,
often referred to as the downbeat (1) and upbeat (2).
</div>

### Emphasis in West Coast Swing Rhythms

There are two basic rhythms in WCS: a "walk-walk"
(or `1 - 2`), and "tri-ple step" (`1 & 2`).  Is there any inherent emphasis on either the first or second beat of
a "walk-walk"? No, the notes are identical*. How about a triple step? (try dancing it!). We should be able to see
and/or feel that there is more emphasis on the `2` of the triple step than the `1` or `1&`. 

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
*You could create a walk-walk with varying emphasis between beats by e.g. adjusting
the rate of weight transfer between steps, that is no longer the basic.
</div>

There are two main reasons why the `2` is more emphasized: Firstly, the 2 is the longest step, taking up a
whole beat, whereas the `1` and `1&` are only a half-beat each. Secondly, there is a speed change
from `1&` to `2`. The `1`, and `1&` are faster, but the `2` is a full beat, slower than the other beats. This
change in speed helps create emphasis by building anticipation during the faster steps and
releasing it on the transition to the slow step. These two reasons appear
identical in this case, but when we look at other rhythms later on we'll see that they can produce different
results.

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
Consider how a partnership might hit a phrase change by dancing repeated turns into a
relatively stationary pose. The repeated turns are building anticipation which is released when the motion
is stopped. The same thing is happening in our triples, but on a much shorter time scale. 
</div>

While we can modify our "walk-walks" to fit music better, a basic "walk-walk" doesn't naturally
emphasize the `1` or `2` over the other. This means walk-walks can fit with practically _any_
musical rhythm we might encounter which doesn't help us when trying to discern WCS music. 
Thus, I'm going to consider the triple step our
fundamental WCS rhythm. After all, who has ever heard of a
judge complaining about "not enough walk-walks"?[^what_judges_want]


### Emphasis in Musical Rhythms

Let's look at rhythm in music next. Here's a song that I often use for teaching beginner
classes because of the clear rhythm: "So Young" by Portugal the Man.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4SNtyKNyYJ8ERT7YLlnFBr?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>


<p>
If you're familiar with musical notation, I've transcribed the basic rhythm of each song below each song:
<img src="/assets/img/so_young.svg" alt="'So Young' rhythm transcript"></p>


What can we hear in the rhythm section? There is a bass drum on every `1`, snare on every `2`, and 
a hi-hat on `1 & 2 &`.

What beat stands out the most? Most of us would say count `2`, where the snare drum
lands. Snare drums have a sharp, percussive sound, at a pitch that humans are more sensitive to
[^A_weighting]. The repeated accent on every second beat is called a
[_backbeat_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(music)#Backbeat), and is the foundation of
jazz, blues, soul and hip hop music [^backbeat_history]<sup>,</sup>[^backbeat_lit_review]. Count `1`
has the bass drum which provides less emphasis than the snare drum.

This brings us to the first metric that I use to help me tell if a song is a WCS song:
**emphasis**. Does the music emphasize (or accentuate) the same beats as WCS? Since we've already
established WCS emphasizes the `2`, we can simply ask: Does the music emphasize count 2?

Let's listen to some music and see what we come up with: Here is "Maps" by Maroon 5:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4gbVRS8gloEluzf0GzDOFc?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

<p><img src="/assets/img/maps.svg" alt="'Maps' rhythm transcript"></p>

Notice how the every beat has the same emphasis, particularly in the drums? This rhythm is called a four-on-the-floor. You _can_ WCS to this,
but this rhythm is more suited to something like Modern Jive[^modern_jive].


A different rhythm is used in "Play that Song" by Train:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/77hjM9bMmgfTGJXv14UFmi?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

<p><img src="/assets/img/play_that_song.svg" alt="'Play that Song' rhythm transcript"></p>

While the snare drum can be heard on every `2`, if you listen closely you'll notice that the
there is also a fairly strong emphasis on every `1`, which indicates to me that this is [6/8
meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature#Characteristics).

The emphasis on `1` comes from a few things:
- The lyrics, which often put a stressed syllable on the `1`
- A synth/brass note on the `1` (during the chorus)
- A double-kick on the bass drum which finishes on `1` 


This repeated emphasis on every `1` detracts from the `2`. So while it's still dancable, I don't consider this a natural West Coast Swing song. 

To summarize our first metric, we can say:


> A West Coast Swing song should emphasize every
second beat, to match the emphasis of a triple step

### Timing of West Coast Swing and Musical Rhythms

How do we measure timing in West Coast Swing? Most dancers, at least when talking about basic patterns,
would say "we look at the strike of the foot on the floor". But what are we comparing each foot
strike to? If two people are dancing perfectly even triple steps, but starting at different times, how do
you tell who is off time? We must compare the timing of the
triple steps, to the timing of the music. This brings me to the second metric that I use for
discerning if a song is a West Coast Swing song or not: _Timing_. How compatible is the _timing_ of
the music, compared to the _timing_ of our dance?

In our basics, timing is the strike of the foot on the floor. Let's listen to the first song, "So
Young" again:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4SNtyKNyYJ8ERT7YLlnFBr?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

In this song, there is bass drum on count `1`, snare on count `2`, and the hi-hat in between (`1&`
and `2&`). In total, the song marks `1`, `1&`, `2`, and `2&`. A West Coast Swing triple step marks `1`,
`1&` and `2`, so by doing our basic footwork rhythm, we are always "on time" with the music. 

Here is another song I often use: "I Got the Blues", by Brother Yusef

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4IKP2r5yvufoDdamX5YSan?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>
<p><img src="/assets/img/i_got_the_blues.svg" alt="'I Got the Blues' rhythm transcript"></p>


Notice how the "&" counts have been shifted towards the end of the beat? Rather than evenly spaced `1..&..2..&..`,
it more resembles `1...&.2...&.`. This is [_swung
music_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(jazz_performance_style)#Genres_using_swing_rhythm),
which is often notated with an `a` replacing the `&`, e.g. `1..a2..a1..a2` instead
of `1.&.2.&.1.&.2`. We can still dance WCS triples to this, 
as we can delay the middle step of our triple steps to match the timing of the `a` count. 

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
Original forms of West Coast Swing would have likely only been` dance`d with swung triples,
since the vast majority of jazz, blues and swing music is swung. 
</div>

Now for a more complicated timing structure, "Hold the Line" by TOTO:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4aVuWgvD0X63hcOCnZtNFA?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

<p><img src="/assets/img/hold_the_line.svg" alt="'Hold the Line' rhythm transcript"></p>


This song marks three evenly-spaced notes (on the piano and hi-hat) for every beat, which are called (musical) [triplets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuplet#Triplet). This is often notated
`1 e a 2 e a` but it can also be considered a 12/8, or "shuffle" rhythm, where you could count "**1** 2 3
**4** 5 6 **7** 8 9 **10** 11 12". I'll use the `1 e a 2 e a` notation as it is more similar to the 
other notations I've used. This rhythm doesn't affect our timing much 
because we can still dance a WCS triple on the `1 . a 2` by just ignoring the `e`.
If you tried to dance on `1 e . 2`, it would feel a bit weird, because the biggest change in speed now
happens on the `e`, which has the effect of shifting some of the emphasis away from the `2`. 

By dancing `1 . a 2`, 12/8 feels like a natural WCS rhythm, and it's personally one of my favorites
because it can give modern pop songs the swung feeling. Some of the more commonly played songs with a 12/8 rhythm
include [It serves you right to suffer - The Avener Rework](https://open.spotify.com/track/5i4m88OA1OrDx3XSfa2xHE?si=5cada6b700cc41fd) (listen to the
hi-hat) or [Right Round](https://open.spotify.com/track/5i4m88OA1OrDx3XSfa2xHE?si=5cada6b700cc41fd)
by Flo Rida (where the triplets are carried by the vocals). I also have an entire
[playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5httL5Rvux99eE1IU6xJ2D?si=99493c66d98e41c0) of "pop but
swung" songs if you want more. 


Now for a totally different rhythm: "Shape of You" by Ed Sheeran 


<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7qiZfU4dY1lWllzX7mPBI3?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

<p><img src="/assets/img/shape-of-you.svg" alt="'Shape of You' rhythm transcript"></p>


The dominant rhythm this song uses is called a [tresillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tresillo_(rhythm)), which comes
from Afro-Cuban music and made its way into modern pop through artists songs such as
[Kygo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/23fqKkggKUBHNkbKtXEls4?si=mlWrvr_MQ3GpxayUXRTSnA)
 and ["Sorry"](https://open.spotify.com/track/09CtPGIpYB4BrO8qb1RGsF?si=f200a928bbde4808) by Justin
Bieber. A tresillo marks the `1`, `1a`, and `2&`. 


How does the tresillo fit with WCS timing? Both rhythms feature a note on `1`, but none of the other
counts align. 

<img src="/assets/img/shape-vs-triple.svg" alt="'Shape of You' v.s. triple step rhythm">

Some dancers might suggest a using a swung triple, e.g. `1..a2`, which allows us
two of three steps matching the music. but I've never actually seen anyone do this in real life. Dancing `1..a2`
increases emphasis on the `2`, but a tresillo rhythm doesn't marked the `2` at all. Most people end up
dancing evenly divided triple steps (`1.&.2`), which is smoother, but it means two out of three of your steps
aren't on time when compared to the musical rhythm. If this song gets played in a competition and someone is judging
your timing, what rhythm are they going to compare your foot strike to? The fundamental West Coast
Swing rhythm? Or the rhythm of the music? I'm not going to answer that question here, but the
conflict between our footwork rhythm and the musical rhythm means I wouldn't consider this a natural
WCS song. Interestingly, Ed Sheeran's acoustic version of this song has a different
rhythm:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5ULRlgiSPSKTaJN1vU9yso?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

<p><img src="/assets/img/shape-of-you-acoustic.svg" alt="'Shape of You (Acoustic)' rhythm transcript"></p>

This version *does* mark the `2`, with a `1a2` rhythm, making it immediately more natural
for dancing WCS.

However, the presence of a tresillo doesn't always prevent a song from being appropriate for
West Coast Swing. For example, "Josephine" has a persistent tresillo played by a synth, but it's quiet
enough to stay in the background and doesn't have much of an effect on the prominent backbeat. We
tend to focus on the most dominant and repetitive rhythms when classifying music. 

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2V5vmvIwxqVizuaYJgrmlE?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

<p><img src="/assets/img/josephine.svg" alt="'Josephine' rhythm transcript"></p>

Not all tresillos are as subtle though, and in some cases they can shift the resulting emphasis of
the song. For example, "Kiss and Make Up" by Dua Lipa:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7jr3iPu4O4bTCVwLMbdU2i?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

The rhythm of this song is a tresillo mixed with a backbeat (or four-on-the-floor, as it varies throughout the song),
which results in `1..a2.&.1..a2.&.`. While the addition of the backbeat/four-on-the-floor gives us a `2` that
helps with our **timing** metric, the overall **emphasis** of this rhythm is not the same as a WCS
triple step. The normally-dominant `2` is overshadowed by the
`2&`, while `1` takes over as the longest and most emphasized note. This a rhythm I
would expect for Samba or Zouk, but not for West Coast Swing. 

The tresillo + backbeat rhythm exemplifies how note duration and fast->slow transitions can emphasize different notes in
the music, as mentioned [earlier](#rhythm-in-west-coast-swing). The longest note in a tresillo +
backbeat is the `1` (taking 3/4ths of a beat), but the fast->slow
transition occurs in the `a2->2`. 

To summarize the **timing** metric: 

> "The timing of the rhythm in the music should be compatible
with the timing of a basic triple step".

<br>

## Conclusion

Hopefully between the _emphasis_ and _timing_ metrics you can now explain why a song may or may not
feel like a "West Coast Swing song" to you. However it's worth remembering that music theory is not
an exact science, and an individual's perception of rhythm will vary. Pop music is created for listening to, not
dancing, so any structure we try to impose on music is going to be an approximation at best.  

One of the obvious follow up questions you might have after reading this is "Should we dance WCS
to non-WCS music?", and I've been avoiding this question because people tend to get rather...
_passionate_ about it. But maybe I can provide some insight without starting
yet-another-internet-argument.

One of the great strengths of this dance is that we've been able to keep up with different genres of
music as they've evolved, and so I think we should keep trying on new genres of music to see if they
fit. That said, if you ever have the responsibility of choosing music that others will be dancing
to, you should keep in mind the context in which it will be played. 

What do I mean by context? Well, who's your audience? How experienced are they? Is it a competition? Or a social event? If you're
DJing at 4am on the Sunday of an event then you're likely trying to keep people on the dance floor, so
you should play whatever achieves that. But if you're teaching a beginner class and you're telling
the students "we triple step on 1-&-2", then your music should probably have a "1-&-2" that your
students can follow along to!

Caveats: The better you are at this dance, the less you'll see basic timing used. Experienced
dancers can adjust their footwork rhythm to match other components of the song (e.g. the lyrics),
and/or shift the their rhythm to other parts of the their body beyond their feet. Being more
experienced also allows a dancer to keep the character of WCS when dancing to a song that is 
would also be suitable for other styles.
