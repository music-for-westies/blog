# What is West Coast Swing Music?

(intro 1)

If you've been around West Coast Swing for a while you've probably witnessed a debate about whether
we should be dancing to non-West Coast Swing music, but that question raises another interesting
question: What is West Coast Swing Music?

(intro 2)

TODO

(main content)


[Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music) is a genre of music, but most of us would
struggle to dance West Coast Swing to a swing standard from [Benny
Goodman](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1pBuKaLHJlIlqYxQQaflve?si=7469Fl34QROI8JRWH5sfnw), unless
you came from Lindy Hop. Unlike Salsa or Mambo, West Coast Swing hasn't attached itself to a
singular musical genre, and the the pop charts today include rock, electronic, country and more, so
how do we decide what to dance to? Many of us feel like we could identify a "West Coast Swing song"
if we heard it (or we'd try dancing to it, and see how it feels),
but if we had to explain it to someone else, I think we'd struggle, which is why
I've collected my thoughts on the subject here, to hopefully provide others with the tools to
articulate what makes a song "West Coast Swing Music" or not.

One of the early answers I heard to this question was "You can WCS to any song, so doesn't that make
any song a WCS song?". This is kinda like saying "every car is a fast car because it's faster than
walking". Yeah, it's true, but not a very useful if you want to compare cars. Similarly, when I say
a song is a "West Coast Swing" song, I mean that it encourages dancing West Coast Swing *more* than
it encourages other dance styles. 

Side note: I've put together a playlist of songs with a variety of rhythms that goes along with
this post. If you want to test your intuition before reading on, listen to each song and write down
whether you think it has a WCS rhythm or not. Then after reading on, go back over the playlist, and
see if any of your answers changed.

## Rhythm

There are lots of aspects to music, tempo, phrasing, intensity, etc, and I'll talk more about
these in future posts, but the most important thing when matching a dance style to a song is the
_rhythm_. Rhythm means the relationship between different points in time, and the relative _emphasis_ of those
points. In music, those "points" would be different notes, and in dancing, the rhythm is carried by
our bodies. Our West Coast Swing patterns have an innate rhythm, marked by our movement, which we can
compare and contrast with the musical rhythm, which is created by the instrumentation of the song. 


### Rhythm in West Coast Swing

First, lets take a look at the rhythms in West Coast Swing. We have two basic rhythms, a "walk-walk"
(or "1-2"), and "tri-ple step", or "1-&-2", which make up all our basic patterns. Now lets look at
the emphasis of these rhythms: if we do a walk-walk, is there any inherent emphasis on either of the
beats? No, the beats are identical. How about a triple step? (try it out!). We should be able to see
and/or feel that there is more emphasis on the "2" of the triple step than the "1" or "1&". There
are two main reasons why this is the case. Firstly, the 2 is the longest step, taking up a
whole beat, whereas the "1" and "1&" are only a half-beat each. Secondly, there is a speed change on
"2". The "1", and "1&" are faster, but the "2" is a full beat, slower than the other beats. This
change in speed helps create emphasis by building tension/energy during the fast section, and
releasing it on the transition to the slow section. You may think that these two reasons are
identical, but when we look at other rhythms later on, we'll that they can produce different
results.

*as an example, think about how a dancer might hit a phrase change by doing repeated turns into a
static pose. The repeated turns are building energy and tension, which is released when the motion
is stopped. The same thing is happening in our triples, but on a much shorter time scale. 

Because the "walk-walk" doesn't have any emphasis, it can kinda fit with anything, and offer much
when trying to discern West Coast Swing Music. Thus, I'm going to use the "triple-step" as our
fundamental West Coast Swing rhythm, and ignore the walk-walk. After all, who has ever heard of a
judge complaining about "not enough walk-walks"?

### Rhythm in Music

Lets look at rhythm in music next. Here's a boring song that I often use for teaching beginner
classes.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/3EI8AyArwmIyv55C1joiJS?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="380" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>
 
What beat gets the most emphasis? Most of us would say every second beat, where the snare drum
strikes. Snare drums have a sharp, percussive sound, at a pitch that humans are more sensitive to
(TODO link). This repeated emphasis on every second beat is called a
[_backbeat_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(music)#Backbeat), and is the foundation of a lot
jazz, blues, soul and hiphop. (TODO check this)

This brings us to the first metric that I use to help me tell if a song is a West Coast Swing song:
**emphasis**. Does the music emphasize the same beats as our dancing does? Or, since we've already
established our dancing emphasizes the "2", we can simply ask: "Does the music emphasize count 2?".

Aside: As a but this does get more complicated with 4-beat rhythms, such as the
[clave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clave_(rhythm)).

Lets listen to some music and see what we come up with. Try this song, "Maps" by Maroon 5:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4gbVRS8gloEluzf0GzDOFc?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

Notice how the `1` and `2` have the same drum notes? This rhythm is called a four-on-the-floor*,
which means the every group of four counts has the same rhythm. You _can_ West Coast Swing to this,
but It's more suited to something like [Modern Jive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Jive).

*we usually count WCS rhythms in twos because it's the length of both the walk-walk and triple
rhythm. Musicians on the other hand, usually count in fours. More on this in a
future post.

How about "Play that Song" by Train?

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/77hjM9bMmgfTGJXv14UFmi?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

While it does have a snare drum on every "2", if you listen closely you'll notice that the
vocals emphasize the "1". This repeated emphasis on the 1 detracts from the
2, so while it's still "dancable", I don't consider this a natural West Coast Swing song. 

To summarize our "emphasis" metric, we can say "A West Coast Swing song should emphasize every
second beat, to match the emphasis of our triple step".
 

## Timing

Lets move onto the next method I use for analyzing a song, but first, a question:

How do we measure someones timing in West Coast Swing? Most people, at least when looking at basics,
would say "we look at the strike of the foot on the floor". But, what are we comparing each foot
strike to? If two people are doing perfectly spaced triples, but starting at different times, how to
you tell who is off time? Well, you listen to the music of course. You compare the timing of the
triple steps, to the timing of the music. This brings me to the second metric that I use for
discerning if a song is a West Coast Swing song or not: _Timing_. How compatible is the _timing_ of
the music, compared to the _timing_ of our dance?

In our basics, timing is the strike of the foot on the floor. Lets listen to the first song, "So
Young" again:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4SNtyKNyYJ8ERT7YLlnFBr?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

In this song, there is bass drum on count "1", snare on count "2", and the hi-hat in-between ("1&"
and "2&"). In total, the song marks "1", "1&", "2", and "2&". A West Coast Swing triple marks "1",
"1&" and "2", so by doing our basic footwork rhythm, we are always "on time" with the music. 

How about this song, "I Got the Blues", by Brother Yusef? 

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4IKP2r5yvufoDdamX5YSan?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>


Notice how the "&" counts have been shifted towards the end of the beat? Rather than `1..&..2..&..`,
it is more like `1...&.2...&.`. This [swung
music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(jazz_performance_style)#Genres_using_swing_rhythm),
which is often notated with an "a" (pronounced "uh") replacing the "&", e.g. "1 a2" or "a1 a2". This
is still pretty easy to dance WCS triples to, as we can delay the middle step of our triples to
match the timing the `a` count. This is how West Coast Swing, would have originally been danced,
since the vast majority of jazz, blues and swing music is swung (which is where the name comes from). 

How about a more complicated rhythm, "Hold the Line" by TOTO:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4aVuWgvD0X63hcOCnZtNFA?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

This song marks three evenly-spaced notes (on the piano and hi-hat) for every beat, rather than just
2, called (musical) [triplets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuplet#Triplet). This is often notated
`1 e a 2 e a` but it can also be considered a 12/8, or "shuffle" rhythm, where you could count "**1** 2 3
**4** 5 6 **7** 8 9 **10** 11 12", but we'll stick with the `1 e a 2 e a` notation for now. This rhythm
doesn't affect our timing much, because we can still dance on the `1 . a 2`, by just ignoring the `e`.
If you tried to dance on `1 e - 2`, it would feel a bit weird, because the biggest change in speed now
happens on the "a", which has the effect of shifting some of the emphasis away from the "2". 

I don't consider "Hold the Line" a great West Coast Swing Song for a couple of reasons, but it's one
of the clearest 12/8 rhythm examples I could find. Other, more familiar songs with a 12/8 rhythm
might be [It serves you right to suffer - The Avener Rework](https://open.spotify.com/track/5i4m88OA1OrDx3XSfa2xHE?si=5cada6b700cc41fd) (listen to the
hi-hat) or [Right Round](https://open.spotify.com/track/5i4m88OA1OrDx3XSfa2xHE?si=5cada6b700cc41fd)
by Flo Rida (where the triple is carried by the vocals).


Now for a totally different rhythm. Do we all remember "Shape of You" by Ed Sheeran? 


<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7qiZfU4dY1lWllzX7mPBI3?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>


This rhythm is called a [tresillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tresillo_(rhythm)), which comes
from afro-cuban music and made it's way into modern pop through Kygo and
then ["Sorry"](https://open.spotify.com/track/09CtPGIpYB4BrO8qb1RGsF?si=f200a928bbde4808) by Justin
Bieber. It marks the "1", "1a", and "2&". So how do does this fit with our West Coast Swing timing?
The "1" lines up, but none of the other counts do. Some of you might suggest dancing the "1", "1a",
"2", which gets us two of out of three steps matching the music. but I've never actually seen anyone
do this in real life. Dancing "1,1a,2" increases emphasis on the "2", but the "2" isn't even marked
by the music. Most people even up dancing straight triples, 1,1&,2, which is smother, but it means
two out of three of your steps aren't even marked by the music. If this song gets played in a
competition and someone is judging your timing, what are rhythm are they going to compare your foot
strike too? The basic West Coast Swing rhythm? Or the rhythm of the music? I'm not going to answer
that question here, but the fact that is there is conflict between our footwork rhythm and the
musical rhythm, means I wouldn't consider this a WCS song. Interestingly, Ed Sheeran's acoustic
version of this song has a different rhythm:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5ULRlgiSPSKTaJN1vU9yso?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

See how the acoustic version *does* mark the `2`, with a `1a2` rhythm? I haven't 

This isn't to say the presence of a tresillo always makes a song a not appropriate for West Coast
Swing though. For example, "Josephine" has a persistent tresillo played by a synth, but it's quiet
enough to stay in the background and doesn't have much of an effect on the prominent backbeat. 
(This kind of overlaying different rhythms is called a
[Polyrhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyrhythm))

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2V5vmvIwxqVizuaYJgrmlE?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

Not all tresillos are as subtle though, and in some cases they can shift the resulting emphasis of
the song. Take for example, "Kiss and Make Up" by Dua Lipa:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7jr3iPu4O4bTCVwLMbdU2i?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

This is a tresillo mixed with a backbeat (or four-on-the-floor, it varies throughout the song).
While the addition of the backbeat/four-on-the-floor gives us a "2" that helps with our "timing"
metric, it shifts emphasis on the wrong beat. The normally-dominant "2" is overshadowed by the
"2&", while "1" takes over as the longest, and thus most emphasized note, which is an emphasis I
would expect for Samba or Zouk, but not West Coast Swing. 

So, to summarize the _timing_ metric: "The timing of the rhythm in the music should be compatible
with the timing of a basic triple-step".

## Conclusion

Hopefully between the _emphasis_ and _timing_ metrics you can now explain why a song may or may not
feel like a "West Coast Swing Song" to you. However it's worth remembering that music theory is not
an exact science, and peoples perception of rhythm will vary. Pop music is made for listening, not
dancing, so any structure we try to impose on music is going to be an approximation at best.  


One of the obvious follow up questions you might have after reading this is "So should we dance WCS
to non-WCS music?", and I've been avoiding this question because people tend to get rather...
_passionate_ about it. But maybe I can provide some insight without starting
yet-another-internet-argument.

One of the great strengths of this dance is that we've been able to keep up with different genres of
music as they've evolved, and so I think we should keep trying on new genres of music to see if they
fit. That said, if you ever have the responsibility of choosing music that others will be dancing
to, you should keep in mind the context in which it will be played. What do I mean by context? Well,
who's your audience? How experienced are they? Is it a competition? or a social event? If you're
DJing at 4am on the Sunday of an event, then your job is to keep people on the dance floor, and so
you should play whatever achieves that. But if you're teaching a beginner class and your telling
your students "we triple step on 1-&-2", then your music should probably have a "1-&-2" that your
students can follow along to! If you're DJing a competition, beware that your music choices might
create conflict between dancing West Coast Swing, and dancing to the music.
