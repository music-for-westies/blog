There is a general understanding of what makes a song a "WCS" song, ~70-130bpm, 4/4 time, etc. I've also written a more detailed post on what constitutes a West Coast Swing _rhythm_. However, even if all these criteria (tempo, timing, rhythm) are satisfied, a song still might not be enjoyable to dance to. In this post I'm going to cover some additional reasons as to what makes a song a _good_ WCS song.

The aspects of a 
- Difficulty
- Contrast of different time scales
- Emotion

There are plenty of other resources available for dissecting pop music.

## Difficulty

A song I often use for teaching beginner classes is "So Young" by Portugal the Man. I use it for teaching because it has the following attributes:

- a 4/4 time signature
- moderately slow tempo (85bpm)
- a prominent and consistent backbeat
- a simple and clear melody
- standard verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus phrasing
- consistent 32-beat phrase length

All the above attributes are the most "average" for a WCS pop song, and contribute to making this song easy and predictable (i.e. low difficulty). I don't want my students to have to worry about a tricky hits or unexpected phrase changes song when they are focusing on technique or connecting with their partner.

However, when social dancing we generally want to engage with the music to inspire us and help us communicate with our partner, so we want a song that is not as "boring". By varying any of the above attributes (e.g. faster tempo, intricate melody, unique phrasing) we're deviating from the "average" pop song. This gives the song unique and interesting features, but it also decreases the predictability, making it more difficult to dance to.

There is a goldilocks zone of difficulty where a song is not so easy that dancers are not bored, but not so hard that dancers are unable adjust their dance to the match the music. Naturally, the size of the goldilocks zone will vary with the skill level of the dancer, but it will also vary with the context in which the song is played. Competitions are generally already a high-stress situation, but by 3am on Sunday night dancers might already be too tired to engage with a difficult song.

In general, a good WCS song should be not too predictable to be boring, but not so difficult that you can't successfully match your dancing to the music.

## Contrast on time scales

With a . Many focal lines are build (a verse, fr) 

This gives us three different time scales we can operate over:
- 8 counts (a vocal or melodic line)
- 32 counts, i.e. a phrase
- the entire song

(pick that taylor swift song)

As I've mentioned earlier, we want to be able to express ourselves by matching our dancing to the music. 

West Coast Swing is mostly composed of 6 or 8 count patterns. There is a natural rise-and-fall of energy throughout a 6-or-8 count pattern, with a higher energy middle section and a lower energy anchor. There are plenty of options for hitting a phrase change, and plenty of options for adjusting the energy level of a pattern. If you need to extend

When you need a longer increase of energy, two or more patterns can be strung together with rock'n'gos. 
But what happens when you need a longer increase?

Not all pop songs follow such. A lot of rock and EDM music has less contrast from phrase to phrase, instead relying on long builds to high energy choruses. Here is a song with 2.5 phrases (80). 

There isn't anything in our common WCS vocabulary that can fill an entire 80 counts of slow build, so it becomes very difficult to match your dancing to the music.

<rock song e.g. black keys everlasting light>
It meets all the critera of 4/4 time, appropriate tempo, backbeat dominant rhythm. So why don't we hear this played? 

Some people, but I disagree with this. There are plenty of "not-pop" songs that have become part of the WCS repotriate without ever having popular success. 


Almost all the music we dance to is built on sections of 8 counts long. This is often confusing for brand new dancers, or those coming from a more structured dance like salsa or bachata, but it does allow a greater degree of musical expression. Each of our 6 or 8 count patterns has a different rise and fall of energy over the course of a pattern, and so we can select to express how we feel the music.


## Inspiration

I use this song not only because of all the above features, but also because it lacks a number of features that make it a _less_ interesting song. 

Features that this song _doesn't have_:

- dynamic contrast (e.g. the verse and chorus are of similar energy levels)
- lyrical emotional content (it's vaguely wistful, not sultry/funky/soulful/etc)
- a catchy hook

Unless I'm teaching a musicality class, I want my students paying attention to their technique and partner, not the music. For social dancing and competitions however, we usually want the music to inspire us.  

A good WCS song is a balancing act between novelty and predictability.

A song with fluctuating tempos, variable length phrasing, rapidly changing is going to leave dancers frustrated as the vocabulary of WCS doesn't allow them to express what they hear in the music.  


### The "competition only song"

Most WCS competitions (with the exception of routines) will only play ~1:30-2:00 of a song. 
This leads to of music being really, but grueling if played to its entirely for social dancing.

### Emotional content

The wide variety of genres we dance to in WCS lends us to experience . Wistful, and can give each dancer a role to play.

This is one of the reasons I find dancing to songs in a languages I don't know more difficult than they would be otherwise. Often, you can can infer the emotional content by the timber of the singers voice, but sometimes the tone of the song doesn't align with the mood of the lyrics.

, but the lyrics tell quite a different story (the song is a cover from a Rock Opera)

Whenever I hear a song in a language I don't know, I go look up a lyrical translation.
