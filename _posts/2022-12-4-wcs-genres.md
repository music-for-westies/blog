In most forms of West Coast Swing competition, you'll dance . 

(Competition DJs have been having some fun with this recently by creating contrasting categories such as 
songs for "Falling in love" v.s. "Making love")

The three categories most used are 
1. Blues
2. Contemporary 
3. Fast Pop

So what happens when that blues music is... not blues? Take this 

By most accounts, TODO is a TODO song, not a blues song. 

Does this matter? Did I write this entire blog post to just to complain about an incorrectly 
labelled youtube video? Well, no. Not really. The point of "Fast Blues" a competition context is to provide
contrast the other song(s) by providing different rhythms, structures and melodies to dance to. Despite TODO 
being a __ song, not blues, the song is still contrasting enough to exhibit different aspects of the dance.

So why, am I still writing this post? Despite blues, soul, funk and jazz all filling the role of "not pop/contemporary", there are differences between these genres that we should be expressing in our dancing*.


*I should be able to _see_ what genre of music you are dancing to.

Reading this will also help if you ever take a musicality class from me where I'll likely play a straight-timed blues song or a funk song with 12-count phrases just to see if you're paying attention.


```info
Disclaimer time: All of the genres listed below are <i>much</i> more complex than I'm going to talk about.
We tend to enjoy dancing WCS to music that already fits certain criteria (such as tempo, length, predictability), so keep in mind that "Jazz that is good to WCS to" is a very small subset of Jazz in general.
```

## Blues


- are almost always swung
- heavy focus on the rhythm section
- simpler instrumentation and lyrics
- often use 48 count phrases (12 bar blues)
- often use Strophic form

## Jazz

In summary, WCS Jazz songs often...

- are swung, often at ratio higher than 2:1
- have less focus on the rhythm section
- richer instrumentation
- more complex harmonies and melodic progressions
 

## Soul

In summary, WCS Sound songs often...


- feature vocal harmonies and backing instrumentation
- are straight time
- follow a similar verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure to modern music, but predate the post-chorus.

## Funk

In summary, WCS Funk songs often...

- have prominent and complex rhythms
- are technically straight time (for WCS), but can _feel_ swung
- simple (if any) harmonic progression
- have unusual structures and phrasing
