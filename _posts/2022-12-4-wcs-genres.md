In many forms of West Coast Swing competition, you'll dance to multiple different songs. Common methods
to contrast the difference are fast v.s. slow and contemporary v.s. blues. 


So what happens when that blues music is... not blues? Such as in this example: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L52TAZo-BYI

TODO EMBED


By most accounts, "Get Up, Get Down, Get Funky, Get Loose" is a Funk song, not a blues song. 

Does this matter? Did I write this entire blog post to just to complain about how people don't know the difference between funk and blues, and thus we have an incorrectly labelled youtube video? Well, no. Not really. The point of "Fast Blues" this context is to 
contrast with the other song by providing different rhythms, structures and melodies to dance to. 
The first song this couple danced to was slow acoustic contemporary, so a fast funk song is still a 
meaningful change in music.

So why, am I still writing this post? Despite blues, soul, funk and jazz all adequately filling the role of 
contrasting to contemporary pop, there are important differences between these genres that we should be 
expressing in our dancing. I should be able to _see_ what genre of music you are dancing to, even if I can't 
hear the music.


```info
Disclaimer: All of the genres listed below are <i>much</i> more complex than I'm going to discuss here.
I'm only considering the musical attributes of each genre that are most relevant to West Coast Swing.
```

## Aspects

Before, so we can introduce the aspects of music I'll be exploring in a more familiar setting

### Straight v.s. Swung

### Smooth v.s. Rhythmic 

### Structure



## Genres

### Blues

#### Blues Straight/Swung

Usually, the most prominent is the location of hi-hat notes between the bass drum and snare drum. However, other songs may separate the swung and straight. For example, ["Come When I Call - Live"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1G7Gg1cH4VKBu3XaoCppzC?si=8816c272ab104da5) has no hi-hat between the 1 and 2, and instead the guitar and bass are controlling the swung feeling.

Blues is often the first genre aside from , and for good reason. 

Firstly, blues music has a l

Secondly, it often provides the most contrast with contemporary pop. I'm not going to dissect 
modern pop in this post, but it usually has the following attributes

- straight time
- 32 count phrases
- Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus  


Most events and curriculum I've interacted with to will have a workshop or two on dancing blues music, but WCS music education often stops there. Unfortunately this means people often associate anything old-sounding and sung by an African-American as Blues music.



#### Blues Structure

In almost all other moden, the standard length of a phrase is 32 beats long. Blues however, often uses 48 beats per phrase. 
The 48 bar phrase comes with a standard chord structure, called 

```info
It's called 12-bar blues because musicians usually count in bars, and with four beats to a bar you get 4(beats/bar)*12(bars) = 48(beats) 
```

That said, there are plenty of examples of swung music 



A classic WCS example of this is Green Onions, in which you can clearly hear the guitar making its way though the progression.

`1-1-1-1-4-4-1-1-5-4-1-1` 

Which usually uses 

Of course, there are exceptions to any rule. For example, ["The Thrill is Gone"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3cg0dJfrQB66Qf2YthPb6G?si=0957ccf93f224e3b) by B.B. King. It has the 12-bar chord progression, simple lyrics and instrumentation of a traditional blues song, but it's _straight time_, which gives it a smoother feel.     

In summary, WCS Blues songs often...

- are swung
- strong rhythmic feel
- simpler instrumentation and lyrics
- use 48 count phrases (commonly referred to as 12 bar blues)
- use Strophic form


### Jazz



The [walking-bass line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassline#Walking_bass) is common characteristic of Jazz.  

In summary, WCS Jazz songs often...

- are swung, often at ratio higher than 2:1
- have a lighter rhythmic feel
- put emphasis on richer instrumentation and lyrics
- have complex harmonies and melodic progressions
 


### Soul

In summary, WCS Sound songs often...


- are straight time
- feature vocal harmonies and backing instrumentation
- follow similar 
- follow a similar verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure to contemporary pop music, but predate the post-chorus.

### Funk

#### Funk Swung v.s. Straight





So despite us dancing straight-time triples in funk music (more rhythmic and less smooth)

- Superstitious 

There... isn't one. It's the same chord for the entire section. The poor bassist spends the entire verse
on the same note.



If you want more canonical examples of Funk music, take a listen to James Brown's discography. 
Many of his songs have the right rhythm for WCS, but are quite repetitive and so less enjoyable to dance to (e.g. ["The Boss"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6LzjgzpVl0hB3YrBU1b8Z1?si=7b26d35edfb04ba8)). Other songs have such variable rhythms that they become
difficult to dance to (e.g. "I Got the Feelin'"). 

Funk's influence is still seen in some modern music. Most of us would be familiar with 
Dang! or Perm, which both layer complex rhythms and instrumentation over very simple, repetitive chord progressions. 


In summary, WCS Funk songs often...

- have prominent and complex rhythms
- are technically straight time (for WCS), but can _feel_ swung
- have simpler harmonic progressions
- have unusual structures and phrasing


## How does this affect our dancing?

Straight v.s. swung (or, wheverer you are marking the triple rhythm in your body).

Song structure indicates how energy levels change over the course of the song



### Conclusion 

Hopefully you've now got an appreciation for some of the older popular WCS genres.

Remember, genre is just a likely. It's up to you to determine how each aspect of a song
is represented and adjust your dancing to match
