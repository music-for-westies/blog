One of the great aspects of West Coast Swing is the variety of song genres that we can dance to. This is often reflect in competition, where a 3-song heat might involve one fast pop, one slow contemporary and one blues. 

So what happens when that blues music is... not blues? Such as in this example: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L52TAZo-BYI

TODO EMBED


By most accounts, "Get Up, Get Down, Get Funky, Get Loose" is a funk song, not fast blues. 

Does this matter? Did I write this entire blog post to just to complain about how people don't know the difference between funk and blues, and thus we have an incorrectly labelled youtube video? Well, no. The DJ choose a "Fast Blues" song in this competition is to contrast with the other song by providing different rhythms, structures and melodies to dance to. 
The first song in this compeition was slow acoustic contemporary, so a fast funk song is still a 
meaningful change in music that allows the dancers to demonstrate a different set of skills. 

So why am I still writing this post? Despite blues, soul, funk and jazz all providing meaningful 
contrast to contemporary/pop, there are important differences _between_ blues/soul/funk/jazz that we should 
express in our dancing. I should be able to _see_ the difference as the genre changes, even if I couldn't hear the music.


```info
Disclaimer: All of the genres listed below are <i>much</i> more complex than I'm going to discuss here.
I'm only considering the musical attributes of each genre that are most relevant to West Coast Swing.
```

```info
Disclaimer 2: "Genre" is a term encompassing the musical (often called "musical form") alongside the social and historical context of the music. I'm only going to dicuss musical form, but if you are interested in the social and historical context of musical genre, I'll put some more references below.

## Aspects of Musical Form

In the youtube video above, the two songs. To dive deeper, we can look at specific _aspects_ of each song and how they differ. Then we can see how this would apply to WCS 


An audio sample displaying the volume looks more like rolling hills for the first song, and jagged mountain peaks for the second (pics here)


### Timing: Straight v.s. Swung



### Rhythmic feel: Smooth v.s. sharp, light v.s. heavy



The timing of the rhythm also influences the rhythmic feel. The same drum line usually feels heavier when it is swung, and less rhythmic when straight. 

### Structure



## Musical Forms for WCS

### Blues

#### Blues Straight/Swung

Usually, the most prominent is the location of hi-hat notes between the bass drum and snare drum. However, other songs may separate the swung and straight. For example, ["Come When I Call - Live"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1G7Gg1cH4VKBu3XaoCppzC?si=8816c272ab104da5) has no hi-hat between the 1 and 2, and instead the guitar and bass are controlling the swung feeling.  

#### 

#### 

Blues is often the first musical form introduced to WCS students, which explains why people are quick to label a funk, soul or jazz song as blues. Unfortunately most musical education stops there.

Firstly, blues music has a l

Secondly, it often provides the most contrast with contemporary pop. I'm not going to dissect 
modern pop in this post, but it usually has the following attributes

- straight time
- 32 count phrases
- Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus  


Most events and curriculum I've encountered to will have a workshop or two on dancing to blues music, but WCS music education often stops there. Unfortunately this means people often associate anything old-sounding and sung by an African-American as Blues music.



#### Blues Structure

In almost all other moden, the standard length of a phrase is 32 beats long. Blues however, often uses 48 beats per phrase. 
The 48 bar phrase comes with a standard chord structure, called 

```info
It's called 12-bar blues because musicians usually count in bars, and with four beats to a bar you get 4(beats/bar)*12(bars) = 48(beats) 
```

That said, there are plenty of examples of swung music 



A classic WCS example of this is Green Onions, in which you can clearly hear the guitar making its way though the progression.

`1-1-1-1-4-4-1-1-5-4-1-1` 

Which usually uses 

Of course, there are exceptions to any rule. For example, ["The Thrill is Gone"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3cg0dJfrQB66Qf2YthPb6G?si=0957ccf93f224e3b) by B.B. King. It has the 12-bar chord progression, simple lyrics and instrumentation of a traditional blues song, but it's _straight time_, which gives it a smoother feel.     

In summary, WCS Blues songs often...

- are swung
- strong rhythmic feel
- simpler instrumentation and lyrics
- use 48 count phrases (commonly referred to as 12 bar blues)
- use Strophic form


### Jazz



The [walking-bass line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassline#Walking_bass) is common characteristic of Jazz.  

In summary, WCS Jazz songs often...

- are swung, often at ratio higher than 2:1
- have a lighter rhythmic feel
- put emphasis on richer instrumentation and lyrics
- have complex harmonies and melodic progressions
 


### Soul

In summary, WCS soul songs often...

- are straight time
- feature vocal harmonies and backing instrumentation
- follow similar 
- follow a similar verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure to contemporary pop music, but predate the post-chorus.

### Funk

#### Funk Swung v.s. Straight





So despite us dancing straight-time triples in funk music (more rhythmic and less smooth)

- Superstitious 

Whats the chord progression for this song? There... isn't one. It's the same chord for the entire section. The poor bassist spends the entire verse
on the same note.



If you want more canonical examples of Funk music, take a listen to James Brown's discography. 
Many of his songs have the right rhythm for WCS, but are quite repetitive and so less enjoyable to dance to (e.g. ["The Boss"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6LzjgzpVl0hB3YrBU1b8Z1?si=7b26d35edfb04ba8)). Other songs have such variable rhythms that they become
difficult to dance to (e.g. "I Got the Feelin'"). 

Funk's influence is still seen in some modern music. Most of us would be familiar with 
Dang! or Perm, which both layer complex rhythms and instrumentation over very simple, repetitive chord progressions. 
For modern funk artists, see Vulfpek, Parcels or Scary Pockets (who mostly perform covers)


In summary, WCS Funk songs often...

- have prominent and complex rhythms
- have straight 8ths swung 16ths
- have simpler harmonic progressions
- have unusual structures and phrasing


## Identification of Musical Form

If you can idenfiy each of the musical aspects listed above, and apply them to your dancing, is still useful to be able to name the specific genre of the song you are dancing to? Even though genres are a approximate label at best, I would still say yes, for two reasons.

Firstly, when you are dancing, genre identification can help you predict the remainder of the song. I don't remember every blues song by heart, but I do remember that most of of them have 48-bar phrasing, which helps me plan phrase changes a bit better. When I hear a song with a heavy, swung rhythm and pre-electronic instrumentation I know I'm likely dancing to blues music, and therefore I should expect 48-bar phrasing. 

Secondly, if you are trying to play a song with a specific _aspect_ (e.g. you are teaching a class on heavy v.s. light rhythms), it is much easier to pre-filter by genre. Songs on music platforms are usually only cagetorized by genre and artist, not by any of the musical aspects listed above.

Listed below are is a "cheat sheet" for quickly identifying blues/jazz/soul/funk. Keep in mind that genre lables are approximations at best, and exceptions and fusion songs are frequent.

Blues:
- heavy, swung rhythm
- simple vocals and lyrics
- simple, pre-electronic instrumentation
- 48-bar phrasing

Jazz:
- light, swung rhythm
- more emphasis on the lyrics
- 32-bar phrasing, often with instrumental  solo sections

Soul:
- medium, straight rhythm
- emphasis on vocals, often with harmony
- no post-chorus, 

Funk:
- 

## How does this affect our dancing?

Straight v.s. swung (or, wheverer you are marking the triple rhythm in your body).

Song structure indicates how energy levels change over the course of the song



### Conclusion 

Hopefully you've now got an appreciation for some of the popular WCS genres.

Remember, genre is just a likely. It's up to you to determine how each aspect of a song
is represented and adjust your dancing to match
