# Competitions 

In most competitions (aside from the routine divisions), you don't get the entire song. Most heated finals you'll get between 1.5-2 minutes of song time. A key consequence of this is that you wont get dance the bridge or final chorus. Thus if you want to show the high/low energy contrast, you're peak might be in the first or second chorus. 

## Implications

lower energy songs demand less movement, lighter connection, 

This is also why many songs make good competition songs
